# missing-budgie

## Missing-Budgie is a play on the original starter code friendly-parakeet
## This code is supposed to demonstrate a password generator mostly using Javascript

# Languages Used
HTML/CSS/Javascript

### Reflection 
What I learned most during this challenge was how to properly add functions to our variables
as well as how certain variables can connect in different ways and how important labeling can be.
If I could do anything differently I would just make code look a bit cleaner.
