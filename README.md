## Missing-Budgie is a play on the original starter code friendly-parakeet
## This code is supposed to demonstrate a password generator mostly using Javascript

# Languages Used
HTML/CSS/Javascript

# User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

# Description of the Lesson 
The point of this Challenge is to present to the user a password generator that can a lot a password with a length between 8-128
as well as special characters and number, and upper and lower case letters. We also showed prompts in case the User didn't use the 
criteria given.

### Reflection 
What I learned most during this challenge was how to properly add functions to our variables
as well as how certain variables can connect in different ways and how important labeling can be.
If I could do anything differently I would just make code look a bit cleaner.
